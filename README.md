# jEAP OpenAPI Specification Publisher

jEAP OpenAPI Specification Publisher is a library based on Spring Boot to publish the OpenAPI specification of a jEAP application to the
jEAP Architecture Repository Service.

* If activated by providing a valid `jeap.archrepo.url` property, it will
   automatically publish the OpenAPI specification to the jEAP Architecture Repository Service.
* The request to the Archrepo service will be authenticated using OAuth2. By default, an oauth client registration named
  `archrepo-client` is expected to be configured under `spring.security.oauth2.client.registration`.
* The OpenAPI specification will be read and published at application startup, on a best-effort basis. The OpenAPI specification upload
   process is designed to have the least possible impact on application, i.e. it will not block the application or
   cause startup to fail if the upload fails.

See [ArchRepoProperties](./src/main/java/ch/admin/jeap/archrepo/ArchRepoProperties.java) for a reference of all the
available configuration properties.
