    shortDescription: Publishes a jEAP application's OpenAPI specification to the jEAP Architecture Repository Service at startup.
    longDescription: >
      jEAP OpenAPI Specification Publisher is a library based on Spring Boot to publish the OpenAPI specification of a jEAP application to the
      jEAP Architecture Repository Service.

      * If activated by providing a valid `jeap.archrepo.url` property, it will
         automatically publish the OpenAPI specification to the jEAP Architecture Repository Service.
      * The request to the Archrepo service will be authenticated using OAuth2. By default, an oauth client registration named
        `archrepo-client` is expected to be configured under `spring.security.oauth2.client.registration`.
      * The OpenAPI specification will be read and published at application startup, on a best-effort basis. The OpenAPI specification upload
         process is designed to have the least possible impact on application, i.e. it will not block the application or
         cause startup to fail if the upload fails.
    features:
      - Automatically publishes the OpenAPI specification of a microservice to the Archrepo service on application startup
      - Non-blocking, best-effort OpenAPI specification upload to avoid startup delays or failures
